# SafeTrails

- The "SafeTrails" aims to tackle the alarming rate of road accidents in India through a comprehensive mobile application. This solution addresses the lack of caution boards in accident-prone areas by providing real-time safety alerts to users while they are on the move. 

- Leveraging location-based services, the application notifies users about potential hazards and accident points, displayed on a dynamic heat map for enhanced visibility. 

- In the event of an accident, the app offers a quick help feature, automatically sending messages or placing calls to pre-designated contacts for immediate assistance. To ensure accuracy and effectiveness, users are required to activate mobile data or Wi-Fi along with location/GPS settings. 

- Additionally, the application must run in the foreground to receive timely alerts about accident-prone areas, thereby maximizing user safety and minimizing road accidents. Through proactive measures and user-friendly features, the Road Accident Safety System aims to significantly reduce the toll of road accidents in India, promoting safer roads for all citizens.
